gedit filename.l --> lex.yy.c  (.c file)
gcc/cc [-o filename.out] lex.yy.c -ll  --> filename.out
./filename.out

// -ll is to link the lex library
// if you don't include the lex library then have to include extra lines of code
either:

int yywrap()
{
return 0;
}

or:

in the begining of the file :
%option noyywrap;


important: inside the %% everything is case sensitive so be carefull....
